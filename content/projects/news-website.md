## Description

A **React JS news website** that consumes a **REST API** to display up-to-date news articles across multiple categories (business, sports, health, government, etc.).

Users can:

- Browse articles by category
- Open a full **detail view** for each story
- Search for specific topics
- Navigate seamlessly in a **single-page application (SPA)** without reloads

The focus of the project was on clean UI, discoverability, and a smooth browsing experience across devices.
