The integration ensures that all payment data is encrypted and securely transmitted, complying with PCI-DSS standards to protect user information.

The system can track customer activity and automatically send personalized offers, boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty.

- Implemented a customer review system where users can rate products and leave comments. This feature allows users to share their experiences and opinions, helping other customers make informed decisions. Administrators have tools to moderate reviews, ensuring the feedback is constructive and relevant.

- Developed an admin panel featuring detailed sales statistics. The panel includes graphical representations of sales data, such as bar charts and line graphs, displaying sales by category and the number of orders per day. This visual data aids administrators in monitoring performance and making data-driven decisions.
